# ZEOSIO

This is the header-only library for EOS(IO) smart contracts to integrate ZEOS protocol features like zk-SNARK verification or private deposits and withdrawals. Check out the [ZEOS whitepaper](https://github.com/mschoenebeck/zeos-docs/releases/download/v1.0.0/zeos_whitepaper_v1.0.0.pdf) for more Information.

## Description
This library includes all functions and action declarations of the ZEOS smart contracts that are necessary to get started with privacy on the EOS mainnet. It supports input packing for [Groth16](https://electriccoin.co/blog/bellman-zksnarks-in-rust/) and [Halo2](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/index.html) proofs.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mschoenebeck/zeosio.git
```

Include the header file into your smart contract and build as usual.
